# ColorProximitySensor
An API for interfacing with TMD3782x sensors (ex: REV Robotics Color Sensor v2). Also a plugin for ShuffleBoard to show the sensor.

From project's root directory:
`./gradlew :plugin:installPlugin` to install plugin to your ShuffleBoard
`./gradlew build` to build both API and Plugin jars. Use the API jar (in api/build/libs/) as a library in your robot's code.
